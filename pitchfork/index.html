# Pitchfork

### Minimizing memory usage by maximizing Copy-on-Write performance.

---

# Existing Ruby HTTP Servers

## Unicorn

A traditional preforking server

## Puma

Combines preforking and threading to reduce memory usage.

---

# Unicorn

## Pros

- Each worker has its own GVL, so entirely avoid Global VM Lock (GVL) contention.
- Similarly each worker has its own heap, so GC pressure is purely local.
- Requests are handled in a dedicated process, which is better for resiliency, isolation, etc.
- If a request mis-behave, the worker can be killed and reforked.

## Cons

- Relies on Copy-on-Write (CoW) to keep memory usage reasonable, but MRI doesn't play well with CoW.

---

# Puma

## Pros

- Threads allow shared-mutable state, reducing memory usage for a given throughtput.

## Cons

- Threads have to compete for the Global VM Lock (GVL), increasing latency.
- The heap is shared, so GC pause impact all collocated requests.
- A misbehaving request might impact other requests in the same process.
- Can't immediately kill a worker, you first need to evacuate it.

# Memory Usage: Copy on Write (CoW)

CoW allow multiple processes to transparently share memory regions

![](memory-cow.webp#fit-height)


---

# CoW invalidation

Whenever a process writes into a shared memory page, it is transparently copied, increasing memory usage.

Generally caused by:

- Lazy initialization of global state.
- YARV Inline caches.
- YJIT.

In practice CoW effiency rarely goes beyond 60%, generally much less at 40 to 50%.

However, the vast majority of these memory regions tend to stabilize after a while.

# Reforking - Initial boot

- The master process spawn a "mold".
- The mold then spawn the required amount of workers.
- Workers are re-attached to the master process using `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER`

```
PID   COMMAND
100   \_ pitchfork master
101       \_ pitchfork mold (gen:0)
102       \_ pitchfork worker[0] (gen:0)
103       \_ pitchfork worker[1] (gen:0)
104       \_ pitchfork worker[2] (gen:0)
105       \_ pitchfork worker[3] (gen:0)
```

---

# Reforking - Worker promotion

- When some conditions are reached, the master send a promotion signal to one of the workers.
- That worker stop processing requests, and becomes a mold.
- The previous mold exits.

```
PID   COMMAND
100   \_ pitchfork master
102       \_ pitchfork mold (gen:1)
103       \_ pitchfork worker[1] (gen:0)
104       \_ pitchfork worker[2] (gen:0)
105       \_ pitchfork worker[3] (gen:0)
```

---

# Reforking - Worker rollout

- After a new mold has been promoted, old generation workers are rolled out
- New workers are forked from the new mold.

```
PID   COMMAND
100   \_ pitchfork master
102       \_ pitchfork mold (gen:1)
106       \_ pitchfork worker[0] (gen:1)
107       \_ pitchfork worker[1] (gen:1)
108       \_ pitchfork worker[2] (gen:1)
109       \_ pitchfork worker[3] (gen:1)
```

# Benchmark - Application

- 100k methods.
- Each method lookup a single constant.
- This demonstrates the impact of inline caches on CoW invalidations.

```ruby
module App
  module Const0; end
  def self.lookup_0
    Const0
  end
  # etc...

  def self.warmup
    lookup_0
    lookup_1
    # etc...
  end
end

run lambda { |env|
  App.warmup
  [ 200, { 'content-type' => 'text/plain' }, [ "OK" ] ]
}
```

# Benchmark - Puma

- Using 2 worker processes.
- Each worker has two threads.
- Total memory usage is ~600MiB.

```bash
$ PORT=9292 bundle exec benchmark/cow_benchmark.rb puma -w 2 -t 2 --preload
Booting server...
Warming the app with ab...
Memory Usage:
Single Worker Memory Usage: 207.5 MiB
Total Cluster Memory Usage: 601.6 MiB
```

---

# Benchmark - Pitchfork

- Using 4 worker processes.
- Total memory usage is ~320MiB.

```bash
$ PORT=8080 bundle exec benchmark/cow_benchmark.rb pitchfork -c examples/pitchfork.conf.minimal.rb 
Booting server...
Warming the app with ab...
Memory Usage:
Single Worker Memory Usage: 62.6 MiB
Total Cluster Memory Usage: 320.3 MiB
```

---

# Conclusion

- Pitchfork retain all the advantages of process based servers like Unicorn.
- Memory usage is drastically reduced via improved CoW efficiency.
- No GVL contention.
- No shared mutable state.
- Allow to share YJIT generated code.
