- counter caches desynchronization 
	- the opportunity slide: its v wordy, could be shorter bullet points
	- The diff/change you showed that was supposed to stop using active record counter caches is a change to use it? 
	- SQL slide: imo still kinda wordy, could simplify the words to "atomic and no race conditions" and title each of the screen shot to increment and decrement
	- really good example!! I really loved it.
	- takeaway slide could be less wordy too
- mastodon marshal bug
	- explanation for the actual bug could be clearer i had to try hard to follow your words at some parts (but i imagine that'll come with practice iterations of the presentation) 
		- maybe add an example of the bug in Marshal in ruby 3.2 vs older versions so it is easier to explain upfront? 
	- ah, i see that you do show a reproducible example later on
		- i recommend trying to put that bit in the beginning when you first show the bug so people can understand the bug before you talk about the theory / solutions 
	- takeaway slide too wordy 
- i think ending could be less abrupt
	- ideas: maybe say you enjoyed working on 10 years of rails bug fixes 
	- maybe remind people that your seemingly infinite rails knowledge was from 10 years of experience and encourage people to start working on it now to build context 
- overall it was a great talk, i learnt a lot. üëè you did a great job of balancing the explanation of the bugs from a technical and social perspective. I also appreciate understanding your thought process (e.g. finding min reproducible code, etc.). Also like that you were vulnerable with sharing mistakes.
- the biggest two complaints are: slides should be less wordy and the marshal bug explanation could be more polished.
    - i find myself trying to read but also while listening to what you're saying, which is distracting
	- if you think you'll forget details, just put it in the speaker notes?
- additional nitpicks:
	- highlight some parts of code/comments that are important so people don't have to try to read the entire screenshot 
	- some text/code can be larger to fix the entire slide


another add: i don‚Äôt quite understand what you meant when you say instance variables are arranged by instance vs. classes in slide 45. do u mean by instance and class ID? (edited)
