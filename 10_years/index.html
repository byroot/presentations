# The Opportunity

- In late October 2013, I joined the newly created Shopify office in Montr√©al
- The team was growing so fast that I often didn't really have work assigned
- So I started looking at the oldest issues on GitHub and tried fixing them, making a bit of a bug squasher reputation for myself
- Until one day, I my lead mentions a slow database query issue
- Little did I know, this would lead to my first sizeable Rails contribution

---

![](images/slow_count_query.png#fit-width)

`126ms` is a lot of time, even for a background job

---

Active Record provide counter caches to avoid slow `COUNT` queries

![](images/active_record_count.png#fit-width)

But for some reason, a change was made to explicitly not use the counter cache

---

Almost a year prior, it was reported that counter caches were obviously wrong ü§®

![](images/negative_counter_caches.png#fit-width)

Some fixes were attempted, like moving counter caches to Redis, but it didn't solve the problem.

---

How counter caches (are supposed to) work

```ruby
create_table :collections do |t|
  t.integer :products_count, default: 0
end
```

```ruby
class Collection < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :products
end
```

```ruby
collection.products_count # => 0
collection.products.create!(...)
collection.products_count # => 1

collection.products.first.destroy
collection.products_count # => 0
```

---

Going one layer deeper

```sql
BEGIN

UPDATE collection SET products_count = products_count + 1 WHERE id = 1;

INSERT INTO products VALUES (2, ...);

COMMIT
```

```sql
BEGIN

UPDATE collection SET products_count = products_count - 1 WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM products WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT
```

The increment or decrement is done atomically on the database side, inside the same transaction that insert or delete the record

‚Äú Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer‚ÄØ‚Äù


![](images/counter_cache_initial_assessment.png#fit-width)


Several colleagues tried to fix this issue without success, assuming it was a concurrency issue, so obviously it must have been something else.

Additionally, counter caches had been in Rails pretty much since its inception, surely someone else would have noticed that a long time ago.

So I started looking at their implementation to try to guess what we may be doing wrong.

---

Counter Caches in Rails 3.2:

```ruby
module ActiveRecord::Associations::Builder
  class BelongsTo < SingularAssociation #:nodoc:
    private

      def add_counter_cache_callbacks(reflection)
        cache_column = reflection.counter_cache_column
        name         = self.name

        method_name = "belongs_to_counter_cache_after_create_for_#{name}"
        mixin.redefine_method(method_name) do
          record = send(name)
          record.class.increment_counter(cache_column, record.id) unless record.nil?
        end
        model.after_create(method_name)

        method_name = "belongs_to_counter_cache_before_destroy_for_#{name}"
        mixin.redefine_method(method_name) do
          record = send(name)

          if record && !self.destroyed?
            record.class.decrement_counter(cache_column, record.id)
          end
        end
        model.before_destroy(method_name)
      end
  end
end
```

---

It was essentially generating this code:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :collections

  after_create :increment_counter_cache_for_collection
  before_destroy :decrement_counter_cache_for_collection

  private

  def increment_counter_cache_for_collection
    Collection.increment_counter(:products_count, collection.id)
  end

  def decrement_counter_cache_for_collection
    Collection.decrement_counter(:products_count, collection.id)
  end
end
```

The logic appeared sound. My only theory at this point was that since they were implemented as model callbacks,
perhaps some of our code was bypassing callbacks.

But a careful audit of the application didn't reveal anything like that, so I was back to square one.

---

### Searching for more clues.

Looking at the faulty records in production, the counter caches were always lower than they should be, never higher. So the issue must be on the `destroy` code path.

Perhaps it was indeed a concurrency issue. Let's try to reproduce it locally.

```bash
$ rails new counter_caches_debug
$ rails generate scaffold Collection title:string products_count:integer
$ rails generate scaffold Product collection:references
$ echo 'worker_processes 8' > config/unicorn.production.rb
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.production.rb config.ru
```


---

Then I created some records, and started mashing my mouse on the destroy button, until this happened

![](images/counter_cache_local_repro.png#half-height)


---

![](images/counter_cache_local_repro_logs2.png#fit-width)

On the above logs, we can see that both process load the product, then they both delete it.

If we serialize what happened, it looks like this:

```ruby
product_1 = Product.find(4)
product_2 = Product.find(4)

product_1.destroy
product_2.destroy
```

---

The problem is that the `DELETE` query will succeed regardless of whether the record still exist or not.

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

So if the `DELETE` succeeds, the transaction is committed, and the counter cache decrementation also succeeds, causing the desynchronisation.
