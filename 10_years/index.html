# The Opportunity

- In late October 2013, I joined the newly created Shopify office in Montr√©al
- The team was growing so fast that I often didn't really have work assigned
- So I started looking at the oldest issues on GitHub and tried fixing them, making a bit of a bug squasher reputation for myself
- Until one day, I my lead mentions a slow database query issue
- Little did I know, this would lead to my first sizeable Rails contribution

---

![](images/slow_count_query.png#fit-width)

`126ms` is a lot of time, even for a background job

---

Active Record provide counter caches to avoid slow `COUNT` queries

![](images/active_record_count.png#fit-width)

But for some reason, a change was made to explicitly not use the counter cache

---

Almost a year prior, it was reported that counter caches were obviously wrong ü§®

![](images/negative_counter_caches.png#fit-width)

Some fixes were attempted, like moving counter caches to Redis, but it didn't solve the problem.

---

How counter caches (are supposed to) work

```ruby
create_table :collections do |t|
  t.integer :products_count, default: 0
end
```

```ruby
class Collection < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :products
end
```

```ruby
collection.products_count # => 0
collection.products.create!(...)
collection.products_count # => 1

collection.products.first.destroy
collection.products_count # => 0
```

---

Going one layer deeper

```sql
BEGIN

UPDATE collection SET products_count = products_count + 1 WHERE id = 1;

INSERT INTO products VALUES (2, ...);

COMMIT
```

```sql
BEGIN

UPDATE collection SET products_count = products_count - 1 WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM products WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT
```

The increment or decrement is done atomically on the database side, inside the same transaction that insert or delete the record

---


‚Äú Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer‚ÄØ‚Äù


![](images/counter_cache_initial_assessment.png#fit-width)


Several colleagues tried to fix this issue without success, assuming it was a concurrency issue, so obviously it must have been something else.

Additionally, counter caches had been in Rails pretty much since its inception, surely someone else would have noticed that a long time ago.

So I started looking at their implementation to try to guess what we may be doing wrong.

---

Counter Caches in Rails 3.2:

```ruby
module ActiveRecord::Associations::Builder
  class BelongsTo < SingularAssociation #:nodoc:
    private

      def add_counter_cache_callbacks(reflection)
        cache_column = reflection.counter_cache_column
        name         = self.name

        method_name = "belongs_to_counter_cache_after_create_for_#{name}"
        mixin.redefine_method(method_name) do
          record = send(name)
          record.class.increment_counter(cache_column, record.id) unless record.nil?
        end
        model.after_create(method_name)

        method_name = "belongs_to_counter_cache_before_destroy_for_#{name}"
        mixin.redefine_method(method_name) do
          record = send(name)

          if record && !self.destroyed?
            record.class.decrement_counter(cache_column, record.id)
          end
        end
        model.before_destroy(method_name)
      end
  end
end
```

---

It was essentially generating this code:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :collections

  after_create :increment_counter_cache_for_collection
  before_destroy :decrement_counter_cache_for_collection

  private

  def increment_counter_cache_for_collection
    Collection.increment_counter(:products_count, collection.id)
  end

  def decrement_counter_cache_for_collection
    Collection.decrement_counter(:products_count, collection.id)
  end
end
```

The logic appeared sound. My only theory at this point was that since they were implemented as model callbacks,
perhaps some of our code was bypassing callbacks.

But a careful audit of the application didn't reveal anything like that, so I was back to square one.

---

### Searching for more clues.

Looking at the faulty records in production, the counter caches were always lower than they should be, never higher. So the issue must be on the `destroy` code path.

Perhaps it was indeed a concurrency issue. Let's try to reproduce it locally.

```bash
$ rails new counter_caches_debug
$ rails generate scaffold Collection title:string products_count:integer
$ rails generate scaffold Product collection:references
$ echo 'worker_processes 8' > config/unicorn.production.rb
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.production.rb config.ru
```


---

Then I created some records, and started mashing my mouse on the destroy button, until this happened

![](images/counter_cache_local_repro.png#half-height)

Anecdote: the race condition became too small on modern hardware and software to reproduce like I did back in the day, so I had to sprinkle some sleep statements.

---

![](images/counter_cache_local_repro_logs2.png#fit-width)

On the above logs, we can see that both process load the product, then they both delete it.

If we serialize what happened, it looks like this:

```ruby
product_1 = Product.find(4)
product_2 = Product.find(4)

product_1.destroy
product_2.destroy
```

---

The problem is that the `DELETE` query will succeed regardless of whether the record still exist or not.

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

So if the `DELETE` succeeds, the transaction is committed, and the counter cache decrementation also succeeds, causing the desynchronisation.

---

A failing test case can easily be crafted:

```ruby
test "sequential delete of the same record only decrement counter once" do
  collection = collections(:featured)

  first_collect = Collect.find(collects(:first).id)
  second_collect = Collect.find(collects(:first).id)

  assert_difference -> { collection.reload.products_count }, -1 do
    first_collect.destroy
    second_collect.destroy
  end
end
```

Now that we have a fast feedback loop, we can work on a fix.

---

But before that, it's preferable to search for existing solutions.

![](images/counter_caches_lock_pr.png#fit-height)

Turns out there was one submitted more than a year earlier, but it wasn't merged because the performance impact was too big.

Surely, we can find something better ü§î

---

When playing directly with the MySQL shell, it hit me that MySQL tells us how many records were actually deleted.

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE products.id = 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

If we could access this count from Ruby, we could tell whether the record was already deleted, and just not issue the decrement.

---

Turns out Active Record already has this information:

```ruby
>> Product.count
=> 1
>> Product.delete_all
=> 1
>> Product.delete_all
=> 0
```

And ultimately `ActiveRecord::Base#destroy` calls `delete_all`:

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module Persistence
    def destroy
      raise ReadOnlyRecord if readonly?
      destroy_associations
      destroy_row if persisted?
      @destroyed = true
      freeze
    end

    private

    def destroy_row
      relation_for_destroy.delete_all # 0 or 1
    end
  end
end
```
---

The problem is that since counter caches are implemented as model callbacks, they don't have access to this information.

So we need to refactor them to proper first class features:

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module CounterCache
    private

    def destroy_row
      affected_rows = super

      if affected_rows > 0
        # snip... decrement counters
      end

      affected_rows
    end
  end
end
```

---

We converted this fix into a monkey patch because.

  - We were quite sure we had a proper fix, but was it the only bug?
  - We also needed the fix now, and not for the next release of Rails.
  
After several months, we still couldn't notice any more desynchronisations, so we started using the counter cache again,
solving the slow `COUNT` query issue.

![](images/active_record_count_revert.png#fit-width)


---

But now it was time to fix Rails

![](images/counter_cache_pr.png#fit-height)

It felt really good submitting a clean solution for a long standing bug.

---

However Aaron would see it that way üòû

![](images/counter_cache_pr_tenderlove_solution.png#fit-height)

Aaron didn't properly understand the bug nor the fix, I was a bit disapointed/shocked.

---

My English and communication skils in general weren't great at the time...

![](images/counter_cache_pr_stupid_answer.png#fit-height)

I answered quite stupidly.

---

Now that I maintains lots of projects, including Rails, I better understand how this dynamic works.

I've just spent days thinking about this problem, Aaron had much less (fresh) context on the feature and issue than I did.

Maintainers can be wrong, especially on large projects like Rails where there isn't a single maintainer that either wrote or reviewed all the code.

You've identified and fixed a bug, your head is full of context, the challenge is to identify the relevant information and write it down in the PR to share
it with the maintainer.

I didn't do a good job of that at first.

---

Lucky for me, Aaron is a nice person, so He simply joked about my blunder.

![](images/counter_cache_pr_joke.png#fit-height)

Many maintainers wouldn't have taken it this well.

The PR was ultimately merged, as well as a couple followups.

---

# Takeaways

Aside from the technical aspects of this fix, what I'm trying to convey here is:

  - Think of your dependencies like code written by a colleague, you should be ready to debug and fix it yourself.
  - This also implies that fixing a bug in a dependency shouldn't necessitate any kind of authorization from a manager.
  - Step one of debugging is to get a reproduction.
  - Worst case if you can't figure out the bug yourself, the reproduction will make it much easier for the maintainers to fix it.
  - Communication is extremely important. You must be able to transmit everything you understood to the maintainer.
  - Try to be nice. Make the maintainer want to help you.

![](images/mastodon_bad_explanation.png#fit-height)

I went quickly over the issue assuming it was a simple Rails limitation.

---

But quickly realized I was wrong:

![](images/mastodon_answer_marshal_load.png#fit-height)

Again, I was initially too overconfident.

My initial theory didn't explain why it was a Ruby 3.2 only bug, so it couldn't be it.

At this stage the obvious suspect was a change in `Marshal`, but the diff didn't show anything relevant.

Note: I don't think I ever figured a bug looking at a git log longer than a handful of commits.

---

As more information come in, we can reduce the possibilities

![](images/mastodon_error_in_marshal_dump.png#fit-height)

At this stage, it's extremely likely that the problem is in `Marshal.dump` on Ruby 3.2.

Somehow, it now behave differently.

---

Someone shares a broken Marshal payload, allowing to narrow the issue further

![](images/mastodon_broken_payload.png#fit-width)

---

The theory is now that attributes are improperly ordered:

![](images/mastodon_broken_payload_comment.png#fit-width)

---

At this stage, I suspect we're running in a case like this:

```ruby
class Status
  def initialize
    @association_cache = nil
    @attributes = { id: 42 }
    @association_cache = { self => 1 }
  end

  def hash
    @attributes.fetch(:id)
  end
end

Status.new.instance_variables # => [:@association_cache, :@attributes]
payload = Marshal.dump(Status.new)
Marshal.load(payload) # NoMethodError (undefined method `fetch' for nil:NilClass)
```

To understand this snippet we need to explain how Marshal and instance variables works.

---

### Quick note on Marshal

Marshal is a "stack" based format:

```ruby
class Foo
  def initialize
    @attr1 = 1
    @attr2 = 2
  end
end

p Marshal.dump(Foo.new) # => "\x04\bo:\bFoo\a:\v@attr1i\x06:\v@attr2i\a"
```


```ruby
[
  "\x04\x08", # Marshal prefix
  "o", # Object
  ":\x08Foo", # Class name as symbol. `:` mark the symbol followed by the size (8 == 4 << 1)
  "\x07", # Number of instance variables (2 + 0x05).
  ":\v@attr1", # First instance variable name.
  "i\x06", # 1
  ":\v@attr2", # Second instance variable name.
  "i\x07" # 2
]
```

Marshal read these instructions one by one, and apply them sequentially.

---

```ruby
Marshal.load("\x04\bo:\bFoo\a:\v@attr1i\x06:\v@attr2i\a")
```

Is similar to:
```ruby
object = Object.const_get(:Foo).allocate
object.instance_variable_set(:@attr1, 1)
object.instance_variable_set(:@attr2, 2)
object
```

The key thing to understand here is that `Marshal` doesn't load objects atomically.

At this stage the theory is that what is happening is that something cause Marshal to call `#hash`
before it has finished to initialize the Active Record model.

```ruby
object = Object.const_get(:Status).allocate
object.instance_variable_set(:@attr1, 1)
object.hash # raise NoMethodError (undefined method `fetch_value' for nil:NilClass)
object.instance_variable_set(:@attributes, active_record_attributes)
```

And the most likely reason for `#hash` to be called, is the object being used as a Hash key.

---

# Ruby instance variables ordering

```ruby
class A
  def initialize
    @a, @b = 1, 2
  end
end

A.new.instance_variables # => [:@a, :@b]

class B
  def initialize
    @b, @a = 2, 1
  end
end

B.new.instance_variables # => [:@b, :@a]
```

---

# Ruby 3.2 Object Shapes

```ruby
class A
  def ordered = (@a, @b = 1, 2)
  def inverse = (@b, @a = 2, 1)
end

p RUBY_VERSION
p A.new.tap(&:ordered).instance_variables
p A.new.tap(&:inverse).instance_variables
```

```ruby
"3.1.3"
[:@b, :@a]
[:@b, :@a]
```

```ruby
"3.2.2"
[:@b, :@a]
[:@a, :@b]
```

Ruby 3.2 significantly changed how instance variables are ordered. It's no longer a per class ordering, but a per instance ordering.

I just happened to know that because I worked closely with Aaron and Jemma who implemented this change.

---

```ruby
class Status
  def initialize
    @relations = nil
    @attributes = { id: 42 }
    @relations = { self => 1 }
  end

  def hash
    @attributes.fetch(:id)
  end
end

Status.new.instance_variables # => [:@relations, :@attributes]
payload = Marshal.dump(Status.new)
Marshal.load(payload) # NoMethodError (undefined method `fetch' for nil:NilClass)
```

Now that we pinpointed a significant difference between Ruby 3.2 and older versions that can
explain what we're seeing, I went to look for a codepath in Active Record that could cause
an instance to have instance variables defined in a different order.

---

We knew the two variables that matter are `@attributes` and `@association_cache`, so I greped
for all the places they were assigned and found this:

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module Associations
    def initialize_dup(*)
      @association_cache = {}
      super
    end
  end
end
```

![](images/mastodon_real_repro.png#fit-width)

---

# SHAPE_TOO_COMPLEX

Shapes are a performance optimization that allows accessing and setting instance variables much faster in most cases.

However, when a class initialize its instance variables in many different orders, the performance of shapes quickly get worse.

So when such a case is detected, the offending class is marked with `SHAPE_TOO_COMPLEX`, and no longer uses shapes.

Instead it stores instance variables in an `id_table`, which is an **unordered** hash.

That's why the bug was so hard to reproduce, it would only happen after the `Status` class was marked as `SHAPE_TOO_COMPLEX`,
which requires to execute many different paths in the application.
