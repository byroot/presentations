# Resilient Applications

# Background - The Resiliency Team

During summer 2014, Shopify experienced a succession of outages which ultimately lead to an all time low availability.

Our customers trust was disminished, and with the holiday season approaching, availabilty became the #1 priority.

A 6 people team was formed to improve the situation.

  - [@graemej](https://github.com/graemej) - Graeme Johnson
  - [@fw42](https://github.com/fw42) - Florian Weingarten
  - [@sirupsen](https://github.com/sirupsen) - Simon Eskildsen
  - [@csfrancis](https://github.com/csfrancis) - Scott Francis
  - [@eapache](https://github.com/eapache) - Evan Huus
  - [@byroot](https://github.com/byroot) - Jean Boussier

# Shits happen

### A selection of witnessed production incidents

  - Wrong server unplugged for maintenance
  - Weird network packets drop
  - MySQL segfaults every nights at 3 am


  - Memcache 100Mbit/s link
  - Redis KEYS / FLUSHDB
  - ElasticSearch stop the world GC
  - MySQL query planner shenanigans (slow queries)

---

# Understanding Availability

- It's usally expressed in percentage: `99.99%` -> `4m20s` of downtime per month.

- Your app availability is at best the combinaison of the availability of all your hard dependencies.

- If you have N dependencies with `99.99%` availability, you can't expect more than `99.99%^N` availability.

- Example `10` dependencies at `99.99%` availability: you are at best `99.9%` -> `43m48s` of downtime per month.


---

# Even the most monolithic applications have external dependencies

Typical stack for non-trivial web apps in 2015:

- RDBMS (MySQL / Postgres)
- Redis
- Memcached
- ElasticSearch
- Load balancer
- S3
- CDN
- Some mailing service
- Some customer tracking service
- Your network provider you probably never heard of
- ...

You probably reached 10 dependencies without realising it.

---

# Classic approach to better availability

### The obvious answer is to increase the dependencies availability

> `A = a^N` then let's make `a` better.

### Problems

- It becomes increasingly more difficult and expensive (maintenance, firedrills, expertise).
- Even the most fault tolerant systems can be brought down by human error or nasty bugs.

You should definitely do it to some extent, but it has it's limits.

---

# The resiliency approach

### Definition

> Resiliency is the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level
of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.

Level of service is most commonly refered as availability.

The goal being to prevent one misbehaving dependency compromising the performance or availability of the entire system.

# Service degradation

# Fail gracefully or fail fast

Cascading failures have mostly 2 root causes

### Functional dependencies (fail gracefully)

Feature `F` needs service `S`. `S` is down, all the sections displaying `F` are unavailable.

### Capacity depletion (fail fast)

One of dependency is so slow that all the threads are stuck waiting for it. The entire app is unavailable.

---

# Failing gracefully

### The dependency matrix

![](matrix.png)

Ideally you should draw it using your integration tests to ensure it's accurate.

---

# Failing gracefully

### Simulating network errors

```ruby
def test_section_a_resilient_to_data_store_b_being_down
  Toxiproxy[:data_store_b].down do
    get '/section_a'
    assert_response :success
  end
end
```

Toxiproxy allows you to temper programatically with any TCP connection your application use to simulate all sorts of outages.

Ideally you want one test per logical section and network dependency combination that is supposed to be without consequences.

# Failing gracefully

### Handling network errors

The classic mistake

```ruby
class Product
  def tags
    redis.smembers("product:#{id}:tags")
  end
end
```

Slightly better

```ruby
class Product
  def tags
    redis.smembers("product:#{id}:tags")
  rescue Redis::BaseConnectionError => error
    ErrorReporter.log(error)
    []
  end
end
```

---

# Failing gracefully

### Abstractions are your friends

```ruby
class PersistentSet
  def to_a
    redis.smembers(key)
  rescue Redis::BaseConnectionError
    []
  end

  def include?(value)
    redis.sismember(key, value)
  rescue Redis::BaseConnectionError
    false
  end
end
```

  - If you handle errors too low, you can't decide on a proper fallback.
  - If you handle them too high, it leads to maintenance hell.
  - The Null Object pattern is usually very handy.

# Failing fast

### Understanding capacity

![](louvre_line.png#fit-width)

> The long-term average number of customers in a stable system L is equal to the long-term average
> effective arrival rate, λ, multiplied by the (Palm‑)average time a customer spends in the
> system, W; or expressed algebraically: L = λW.
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<cite>[Little's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law), 1954</cite>


λ is commonly refered as thoughtput and expressed in requests per minute.
`W` is the average response time and `L` is the capacity.

---

# Failing fast

### Case study

![](capacity.png#fit-width)

An application with an average response time of `60ms` can process `1kRPM` per thread.

So it needs 100 threads to handle `100kRPM` of throughtput.

---

# Failing fast

### Case study

![](capacity_outage.png#fit-width)

If `1%` of the traffic suddenly timeout on a resource after 30 seconds, the response time will raise to `360ms`.

The application now needs 600 threads to handle the same `100kRPM` of throughtput.

If the threads capacity is depleted, the requests will be queued or rejected and the throughtput will decrease.

---

# Failing fast

### Keep your timeouts low

That's how a minor side feature, that represent only 1% of the traffic, can bring the entire application down.

Unless all the timeouts of all the resources are extremely low, it's unrealistic to keep enough capacity to handle the worst case.

Most of the time a few outlier queries prevent the timeout from being reduced.

---

# Failing fast

### Semian

Semian is a library for controlling access to slow or unresponsive external services to avoid cascading failures.

![](github.png#inline-icon)[https://github.com/shopify/semian](https://github.com/shopify/semian)

---

# Failing fast

### Postulate

> If a query to a service failed, retrying it immediatelly will likely fail again.

Therefore querying a service that failed recently is a waste of capacity.

---

# Failing fast

### Semian - Circuit Breakers

<img src="circuit_breaker.png#fit-height" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;" />

- The circuit breaker record all the network errors and timeouts happening on a resource.

- After too many errors happened in a short period of time, the circuit will open and immediately reject any further queries.

- After some time in the open state, the circuit will let a request go throught.

- If it still generate errors, the circuit closes again immediately.

- After several successful requests the circuit will go back to it's original closed state.

---

# Failing fast

### Semian - Circuit Breakers

Although the circuit breakers will prevent further loss of capacity, in case of very long timeouts the
capacity might be totally depleted before they open.

Worse, if the service is extremely slow, but not enough to trigger any timeout, they might not open at all.

---

# Failing fast

### Postulates

> If a service can't keep up with the load it receives, querying it again will only makes things worse.

Therefore querying an already overloaded service is undesirable.

> The application spend 10% of it's time querying a specific service.

Therefore on a server with 10 threads the probability that 5 threads are using that service at any given time is only `0.001%`.

---

# Failing fast

### Semian - Semaphores

<img src="semaphore.png#fit-height" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;" />

- Before actually querying the service, a ticket must be acquired.
- If they are all in use, an exception is raised immediately.
- A lack of ticket is considered as an error by the circuit breaker.


---

# Should I really do all this?

Semian is not a trivial library, and comming with the right settings requires a lot of monitoring, experimentation and care.

If Semian is improperly configured it will create more issues than it will solve.

However there some good practices that are easy to follow early on.

---

# Takeways

### A few advices on how never have to waste time on resiliency

- Always keep your timeouts low, especially the web server one.
  - 5 seconds should be enough for every web request
- Think twice before adding a new dependency
  - And be clear which ones are hard and which ones are soft.
- Put boundaries to everthing.
  - e.g. cap tags to 50 per product, worst case you can charge to raise that limit.
